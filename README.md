[Demo](https://timmybytes.github.io/react-job-list-app/)

A simple React app for entering names and jobs into a dynamic list, with the option to delete entries. The app uses stateful Class Components to create an array of inputed Names/Jobs and render then as a list.

Built from Tania Rascia's tutorial [here](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/), with my own styling additions.
